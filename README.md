# My dotfiles

This is my attempt for make shared repo between Mac and Linux (Archlinux) workstations. After several years I've found wonderful
tool [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) to manage my configuration files.

## Window manager

I just use standard GUI at Mac and i3wm on Linux machine. I would like to try [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) and
[chunkwm](https://koekeishiya.github.io/chunkwm/)

## Terminal emulator

My choice is [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)

## Editor

[NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)
